## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, and you think that it would be better not to open a public issue just yet, then please write an e-mail to <tt>crates.io@k6i.\[Germany\]</tt>.

I check my e-mail every workday Mon to Fri. You can expect an answer in very few days. More severe problems will get reported to <https://rustsec.org/>.
